# PaperTxT
We plan to create an AI which has analytical reading and answering abilities.
The AI would have abilities to read books, analyze them analytically and finally answer logical questions.

# Idea Summary

We plan to create an AI which has analytical reading and answering abilities.
The AI would have abilities to read books, analyze them analytically and finally answer logical questions.
Our project would be divided into three major phrases:-

* Extracting text out of the given source
* Analyzing the given text
* Answering questions from an analyzed database.

We need to create a method to construct logical statements from books(text) provided to achieve this goal. This would involve creating a knowledge base to store the logical statements, deploying a method to access the knowledge base to answer questions.

# Target Audience

We plan to deploy our model in two forms:

* Firstly, we would be providing specialized as well as smart chatbots for companies that have understaffed customer care services.
* Secondly, we plan to create AI readers for people whose jobs require extensive and redundant reading tasks.

# Technical Requirements

Initially, we plan to deploy the model on android phones by reading the text in pdf format. Hence, a basic smartphone would work.

On further progress, we plan to create an independent reader which could be used on stand-alone machines like robots. This would require any device with a processor core(processing capabilities) and a camera module.
